# Robot Dog
This repo contains the code base for controlling a robot dog intended to eventually be a fully physical custom-built robot for autonomous indoor navigation. 
Right now most development is under robot_ws which involves the development of the `ROS2` for the operation of the robot dog. 

While the physical robot dog body exists, we are currently in the progress of working on a virtual copy of the dog to test control algorithms and methodologies
before deploying on the real robot. This is also going alongside creating a custom controller board intended to house a power STM32 MCU, an IMU and more!
