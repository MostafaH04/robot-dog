# Robot Dog

Welcome to the Robot Dog project! This repository contains the codebase for controlling a custom-built robot dog designed for autonomous indoor navigation. Our primary development focus is under `robot_ws`, which involves creating ROS2 packages for operating the robot dog.

While the physical robot dog exists, we are currently developing a virtual model to test control algorithms and methodologies before deploying them on the real robot. In parallel, we're designing a custom controller board featuring a powerful STM32 MCU, an IMU, and more.
